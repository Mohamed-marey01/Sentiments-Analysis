# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This project builds a **Sentiment Analysis** model using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to classify text (such as reviews, tweets, or comments) into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.  

The model captures sequential word dependencies, making it ideal for understanding the emotional tone of text data.
